# Summer Chores - Callback Functions

## Overview of Summer Chores
This assignment demonstrates the use of callback functions in JavaScript by simulating a routine of summer chores. The person completing the chores must follow a strict order but may fall asleep due to exhaustion before finishing all tasks. This introduces conditional flow control using asynchronous operations learned in our material.

## Features of the Assignment
- Callback functions - manage chore execution in sequence.
- Simulates real-world asynchronous tasks using `setTimeout()`.
- Implements falling asleep to simulate fatigue.
- Demonstrates the use of nested callbacks.

## Chore List & Order
1. Mowing the yard
2. Weed eating
3. Trimming hedges
4. Collecting wood
5. Watering the garden

Each task is executed sequentially, ensuring all chores are completed in order unless fatigue causes the person to fall asleep.
